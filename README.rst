Quickstart

2. Install the latest version of svviz from github using the following terminal command: ``sudo pip install -U git+https://github.com/svviz/svviz.git#svviz``. (The sudo may not be necessary depending on your setup.)
3. Run the following command, which downloads example data and runs it through svviz: ``svviz demo``. After several processing steps, a web browser window should open. Click and drag to pan, and zoom using option/alt-scrollwheel.
4. Please report any issues (after making sure they're not explained in the documentation below) using the `github issue tracker <https://github.com/svviz/svviz/issues>`_.
